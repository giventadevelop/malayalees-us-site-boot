# QR Code Generation & Ticket Integration - Architecture & Tasks

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements, schema changes, and step-by-step implementation plan for generating, storing, and associating QR codes with event ticket transactions in the multi-tenant event management system.

---

## 1. JDL/Schema Changes

### Add QR Code Fields to EventTicketTransaction

Add the following fields to the `EventTicketTransaction` entity in your JDL:

```jdl
qrCodeData String maxlength(1000),
qrCodeImageUrl String maxlength(2048),
```

- `qrCodeData`: The string encoded in the QR code (e.g., ticket ID, UUID, or secure token).
- `qrCodeImageUrl`: The URL to the QR code image stored in S3.

### Regenerate Entities

After updating the JDL, run JHipster/entity generator to update Java classes, DTOs, and the database schema.

---

## 2. QR Code Generation Logic

### When to Generate

- Generate a QR code **after a successful ticket purchase** (i.e., after creating an `EventTicketTransaction`).

### How to Generate

- Use a Java QR code library (e.g., ZXing) to generate a QR code image from the `qrCodeData` string.

### What to Encode

- Encode a unique value (e.g., ticket transaction ID, a UUID, or a secure token) that can be validated at check-in.

---

## 3. Storing the QR Code Image

### Upload to S3

- After generating the QR code image, upload it to your S3 bucket.
- Use a unique filename structure, e.g., `tickets/{eventId}/{transactionId}/qrcode.png`.

### Save the S3 URL

- After upload, save the S3 URL (or pre-signed URL) in the `qrCodeImageUrl` field of the `EventTicketTransaction`.

---

## 4. Update the Ticket Purchase Flow

- After a ticket is purchased:
  1. Generate the QR code data string.
  2. Generate the QR code image.
  3. Upload the image to S3.
  4. Save the QR code data and image URL in the transaction record.

---

## 5. QR Code Usage Tracking

- Continue to use the existing `QrCodeUsage` entity to track when a QR code is scanned/used.
- Link usage to the attendee and event as needed.

---

## 6. Optional: QR Code Validation Endpoint

- Implement an endpoint to validate a QR code (e.g., at event check-in).
- The endpoint should:
  - Accept a QR code string or image.
  - Look up the corresponding ticket transaction.
  - Validate its status (e.g., not already used, valid for this event).
  - Record the usage in `QrCodeUsage`.

---

## Do You Need New Entities?

- **No new entities are strictly required** if you only want to associate QR codes with ticket transactions and track usage.
- **You only need to add fields to `EventTicketTransaction`** and possibly update the logic in your services and controllers.

---

## Do You Need to Update the JDL File?

- **Yes:**
  - Add `qrCodeData` and `qrCodeImageUrl` to `EventTicketTransaction`.
  - Regenerate the backend code and database schema.

## Summary Table

| Step | Action                               | JDL/Schema Change? | Code/Logic Change? |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1    | Add fields to EventTicketTransaction | Yes                | No                 |
| 2    | Generate QR code after purchase      | No                 | Yes                |
| 3    | Upload QR code image to S3           | No                 | Yes                |
| 4    | Save QR code data and image URL      | No                 | Yes                |
| 5    | Track usage with QrCodeUsage         | No                 | (Already exists)   |
| 6    | (Optional) Add validation endpoint   | No                 | Yes                |

---

## Next Steps

1. Update your JDL file to add the new fields.
2. Regenerate your entities and database schema.
3. Implement the QR code generation and storage logic in your backend.
4. Update the ticket purchase flow to include QR code creation and storage.
5. (Optional) Add a validation/check-in endpoint.
